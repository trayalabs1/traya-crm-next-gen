                    'At Traya, we recognise that hair loss patterns are different for males and females; hence, we use different scales to categorise and understand the stages of hair fall in each gender. \n\nHair loss in men is often categorised using the Norwood scale, which describes different stages of male pattern baldness. Here\'s an overview of the Norwood hair loss stages with descriptions:\n\nStage 1-2: Hair Thinning and a minimal hairline recession at the temples and front side characterise this stage. It\'s a mild form of hair loss.\n\nStage 3: Stage 3 is characterised by a deeper recession at the temples, forming a more pronounced ""M"" shape. In this stage, hair loss affects the temples and the scalp\'s crown (vertex). The ""M"" shape may become more prominent.\n\nStage 4-5: Hair loss progresses further, creating a larger bald area at the vertex while the ""M"" shape continues to recede. The hairline recession at the temples and the balding at the vertex expand and may start to meet in the middle of the scalp.\n\nStage 6-7: At this stage, the bald areas at the temples and the vertex merge, leaving a hair strip around the head\'s sides and back. This is the most advanced stage, where only a narrow band of hair remains at the sides and back of the head, while the top is mostly bald.\n\nFor females, the hair scale is divided into different stages mentioned below: \n\nNo Widening: Excessive hair fall and thinner strands \nEarly Widening: When you start to see widening with less volume on the partition\nMedium Widening: Increased gap in the middle partition\nAdvanced Widening: Extreme thinning on the partition \nCoin-Sized Patches: Small bald patches on the head or other body parts',

                    "Hairloss is as much internal as it is external. Understanding why it is happening is key to solving the issue. The Traya Hair Test is a comprehensive analysis that considers a range of critical inputs that help us know the root cause of your hairloss and accordingly create your personalised hair regrowth plan. Here's a glimpse into the key factors we take into consideration:\n\nAge:  Hair follicles weaken and slow down as you get older. The connection between age and your hair lies in the gradual weakening of your hair follicles over time, which can lead to hair loss. The regenerative capacity also decreases with age. Understanding your age helps set realistic expectations for your hair regrowth journey.\n\nHair Loss Stage:  Hair loss is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Your hair can be in different stages, and each stage demands a specific approach. Understanding your hair loss stage is like having a guideline; the right treatment at the right stage can make a significant difference in your regrowth journey.\n\nLifestyle:  Your daily habits play a crucial role in your hair health. Your diet provides vital nutrients necessary for hair growth, such as vitamins and minerals. The concept of 'Pitta Dosha' from Ayurveda relates to dietary imbalances that can adversely affect hair health. Exercise enhances blood flow to the hair follicles, promoting growth and reducing stress, a known factor in hair loss. Quality sleep is critical as it allows your body to repair and regenerate hair follicles. Stress can trigger a condition called Telogen Effluvium, disrupting the hair growth cycle by prematurely pushing hair follicles into the resting phase. This results in a noticeable shedding of hair a few months later. Understanding the 'why' and 'how' of these connections is essential in understanding the root causes of your hair loss.\n\nMedical History:  Some medical conditions, including thyroid problems, diabetes, heart issues, and certain medications, have the potential to disrupt your hair's growth cycle. By delving into your medical history, we can precisely pinpoint how these factors impact your hair health. For example, thyroid issues can lead to hormonal imbalances, while diabetes can affect blood circulation to the scalp. In females, even pregnancy and menopause periods induce hairfall. During pregnancy, elevated oestrogen levels can result in healthier hair, but postpartum hormonal shifts often trigger considerable hair shedding. Menopause involves declining oestrogen levels, leading to hair thinning. Recognizing these connections is vital in ensuring that your hair regrowth plan is not only effective but also safe.\n\nGut Health:  Your gut is the gatekeeper to your hair's potential. It plays an essential role in nutrient absorption, ensuring that your body receives the essential vitamins and minerals necessary for healthy hair.\n\nEnergy Levels:  Low energy levels is because of weakened metabolism, where your food does not get absorbed properly and thus the required nutrients don't reach your organs. Low energy levels can be a symptom of underlying health issues like anaemia, chronic stress, and a weakened immune system, all of which can contribute to hair loss. Recognizing low energy as a possible indicator of these issues is vital.\n\nScalp Picture: As part of the diagnostic process, we ask you to provide a snapshot of your scalp's health. The scalp picture helps our doctors in prescribing the right medication dosage before we ship your kit. It is also used by our Hair coaches when they speak with you, and helps them track your progress.\n\nIn conclusion, the Traya Hair Test is an in-depth and holistic approach to understanding the root causes of your hairloss. It goes beyond surface-level solutions by examining various internal factors that contribute to hair health. This comprehensive analysis helps us customise a personalised hair regrowth plan that addresses your unique needs and conditions. It's not just a test; it's your journey to a healthier and happier you.\n",

                    'At Traya, we understand that hair loss affects men and women differently. That\'s why we use separate scales to categorise and better grasp the stages of hair loss in each gender.\n\nAndrogenic Alopecia (Male and Female Pattern Baldness): This common genetic condition is caused by a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which shrinks hair follicles, making them produce thinner and shorter hair until they stop producing hair altogether.\n\nTelogen Effluvium: Often triggered by stress, illness, or hormonal changes, telogen effluvium results in more hair follicles entering the resting (telogen) phase, causing hair shedding. It\'s usually a temporary condition and can be resolved when the underlying issue is addressed.\n\nA. Male Hair Loss Stages (Norwood Scale):\n\nStage 1-2 (Mild Hair Loss):\nAt this stage, men experience hair thinning which results in minimal hairline recession at the front and sides of the forehead (referred to as temples). It\'s the mildest form of hair loss, often not very noticeable.\n\nStage 3 (Moderate Hair Loss):\nHere, there\'s a more noticeable recession at the sides of the forehead (referred to as temples), forming an "M" shape. Hair loss also affects the crown (vertex), and the "M" shape may become more prominent.\n\nStage 4-5 (Advanced Hair Loss):\nHair loss continues to progress, creating a larger bald area at the vertex, while the "M" shape keeps receding. The temples and vertex balding expand and may start to meet in the middle of the scalp.\n\nStage 6-7 (Severe Hair Loss):\nIn this advanced stage, the bald areas at the temples and vertex merge, leaving a narrow strip of hair around the sides and back of the head. The top of the head becomes mostly bald.\n\nB. Female Hair Loss Stages:\nTexture Loss:\nHair starts to feel less shiny, dry, and dull. There are split ends. There may not be any loss of hair at this stage. \n\nNo Widening:\nIn this stage, women experience excessive hair fall, and their hair strands become noticeably thinner. There may be a loss of overall hair volume.\n\nEarly Widening:\nAs hair fall progresses, women may start to see the widening of their hair parting. The hair on the parting becomes sparser, resulting in a thinner appearance, especially when the hair is styled.\n\nMedium Widening:\nAt this stage, the gap in the middle of the hair parting becomes more significant. There\'s a noticeable widening of the part, and the overall volume of hair on the scalp continues to decrease.\n\nAdvanced Widening:\nExtreme thinning is observed along the hair parting. Hair may appear much thinner, and the scalp becomes more visible, leading to a significant loss of hair volume and density.\n\nCoin-Sized Patches:\nSome women may experience small bald patches on their head or other parts of the body. These patches can result from conditions like alopecia areata, which can cause hair loss in localised areas. ',

The aim of giving a diet plan to you is to make your body healthy from within, to give it the desired nutrition that it requires to treat the hair loss problem.\n\nYou can start by eliminating the unhealthy food items- start with reducing spicy, oily, and junk food. Then every week, add one healthy food item to your meals. That way you'll be able to incorporate good food and eliminate unhealthy food from your routine. Focus on a balanced diet with more fruits and vegetables. Remember to stay hydrated by drinking 7-8 glasses of water daily. For a healthier you, just simplify your eating habits. That should work.",
